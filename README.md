# react-basics

<!-- - `npx`: Allows you to run Node packages without installing them globally.
- `npx create-react-app new1`: Used to create a new React project (takes more time and creates a heavier setup, so it's mostly not used now).
- `npm`: Node Package Manager, used to manage dependencies and run scripts.
- Difference b/w React and React Vite:
  - CRA (Create React App) is slower, comes with more boilerplate.
  - Vite is faster, lightweight, and has better dev experience with instant reloads.
- First file we notice after setup is `package.json` which holds metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
- Difference b/w `npm run` and `npm run start`:
  - `npm run` is used to run custom scripts.
  - `npm run start` is a specific script to start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Generates the production build in the `dist` (Vite) or `build` (CRA) folder, not the `src` folder.
- After setting up Vite, no `node_modules` are present initially. Run `npm install` to install required packages.
- Unnecessary files can be deleted to clean up the project.
